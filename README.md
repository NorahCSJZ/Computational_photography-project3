The reasons I chose these pictures are:
First, these pictures were shot when I did my first internship in China, I rememebered that it was the first day that I went to this office.So it is quite important for me. And second is that, these images were quite clear, there are no moving objects or some lights or some shadows, so it is easy for me to do the project. The third is that this building is quite huge, if I can combine them into one, that would be very cool.
